            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>It's been 15 years since Girls' Generation entered the K-pop scene. 
             The eight-member girl group from SM Entertainment has set countless records and is now considered almost a legend. 
            And rightly so: countless idols who debuted after them were inspired to make music by Girls' Generation! 
            The girl group is therefore a piece of K-pop history! </p>
             <img src="images/snsd main.jpeg">
            <p>SNSD is the abbreviation of the group's Korean name "Sonyeo Sidae", which literally means "Generation of Girls". 
            Sonyeo Sidae is often shortened to "SoShi". 
            New fans are often confused by the girl group's many names, but ultimately they all mean the same thing.
